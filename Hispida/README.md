# Connect4: Hispida
Connect 4 in python for AI experiment. Using a minmax algorithm.

### START
To play against one of the robots, run Games/Connect4.py

If you want to automatically let robots play a chosen number of times against each other,
run Games/MultiGame.py


### TODO

### TODO PREVIOUSLY
* Robot accepts history of moves to machine learn
* Replay possibility (for debugging) OR alternatively give grid run_test configuration

### DONE
* Robots.
* Use logger.
* Refactoring: push down method implementations.
* Minmax: Trivial case where a (simple) heuristic is used to evaluate a grid-situation.
* Minmax: Recursive case, where child branches are merged.
* Jsonfication
* Minmax: alpha-beta-pruning
* Game keeps history of moves
