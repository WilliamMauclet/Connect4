# Connect4: Hispida
Connect 4 in python for ML experiment. Using a minmax algorithm.

### START
To play against one of the robots, run Games/Connect4.py

If you want to automatically let robots play a chosen number of times against each other,
run Games/MultiGame.py


### TODO
The current aim is to make a min-max implementation, using recursion.
* Trivial case where a (simple) heuristic is used to evaluate a grid-situation.
* Recursive case, where child branches are merged.

### TODO PREVIOUSLY
* Game keeps history of moves
* Robot accepts history of moves to machine learn
* Replay possibility (for debugging) OR alternatively give grid start configuration

### DONE
* Robots.
* Use logger.
* Refactoring: push down method implementations.
