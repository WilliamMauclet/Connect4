# Connect4
This project is about facing off two AI approaches to the Connect 4 game. 

On the one hand, the Hispida project ("Atheris Hispida") uses a min-max algorithm.

On the other, the ConNET project uses a pattern-matching algorithm.

The shape of the grid is as follows:

> ![The grid coordinates.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WilliamMauclet/Connect4/master/grid.png)

Host = host and port = 9999.
The first player listens. The second player connects and from there the bi-directional communication begins.
The first player makes the first move.
